INPUT:
- Number of particles (e.g., 10,000)
- Decay constant λ (e.g., 0.1)
- Time step (e.g., 0.1 seconds)

SIMULATION:
- For each particle:
  - Randomly determine when it decays
  - Record decay time
  
OUTPUT:
- Histogram of decay times
- Statistical analysis (mean lifetime, standard deviation)
- Comparison with theoretical prediction
- Visualization plots
